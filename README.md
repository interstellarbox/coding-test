# HeartLab Coding Test - Open Clinics ❤️

## Specification 📋

Your task is to take a piece of data describing the opening hours of a number of
clinics, and provide two functions, one to parse the opening hours data, and one
to query the parsed data to find which clinics are open at a specified date and
time.

The input file can be assumed to be well-formed and contain no invalid data, and
all dates and times can be assumed to be in the same time zone.

## Code Skeleton 🎬

A code and test skeleton written in TypeScript is provided to help get you
started.

- Ensure you have Node.js v16 or later installed.
- Install packages with `npm install`.
- To run the test watcher use `npm run test`.
- The recommended IDE is VS Code.
- Using vanilla JavaScript is also an option, but you'll need to change the
  source file extensions and remove the type annotations.

## Example Data 📡

Example data can be found in the `data/example-clinic-opening-hours.ts` file.
Inspect this file to determine the kind of input data that your code should be
able to parse and query.

All the data in `data/example-clinic-opening-hours.ts` are correct and valid.
You can use and extend it for testing purposes, or write your own.

## Deliverables 📦

The first deliverable is the source code for your solution, as either a public
git repository or a zip archive.

The second deliverable is a completed `WRITEUP.md` file containing the
following:

- Any instructions needed to boot and test your solution.
- A summary of the solution's design & architecture.
- Technical justification of key design decisions with comparison to other
  possible approaches.
- Discussion of the scalability of your solution to larger datasets and
  potential optimization approaches.
- Any areas of the design or implementation that could be improved further or
  that you would like specific feedback on.

## Tips 💡

- A simple and straightforward design is preferred. Avoid unnecessary
  complexity.
- Review the input data for possible edge cases.
- Remove debug or other unnecessary code before submitting.
- Remember the tests.
